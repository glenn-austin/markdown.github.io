# What is Journal Entry to Period Close?
A **journal entry** is the mechanism for recording financial transactions into General Ledger. Once posted, a transaction will appear on one or more of the financial statements.

**Journal Entry to Period Close** is one of the key Financial Control and Reporting activities  performed by General Accountants and General Accounting Managers.
